### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I donâ€™t know how it feels to get bored. On the one hand, I like spending my time taking pictures, creating computer graphics, and reading sci-fi or crime novels. On the other hand, I need a little adrenaline and energy boost â€” kettlebell trainings, calisthenics, playing football, mountain cycling, and motorcycle speedway. I used to wonder how it happened that, on top of that, I became a programmer. But since I started working at Codetain it seems so natural to me. Each team is deeply involved in the companyâ€™s development and we all do support each other. Being a part of Codetain is not just IT and programming â€” itâ€™s a lifestyle!
